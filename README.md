# Go Battleship

A Go battleship implementation with client-server support over network (net/http) - 1 to PC.

## Idea

The battleship game has always fascinated me: I first wrote a Java version of battleship during my course of Programming II. I always thought battleship (running in a shell env) is a good exercise to start handle string format, base structs and so on. Then I realized than battleship game itself could be so much more. In recent month I started "Going" (:P) so I will use this readme for both collect some ideas and describe what I've planned right now.

## The game

The base game is famous and simple: two seas, some ships, with different dimensions, and shots that alternate while time lapse. I started defining a generic model that could be use to play with a machine or with another client. 

To be continued...
